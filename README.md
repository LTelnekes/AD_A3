# Assignment 3 - Analyzing Data
This repository includes the third and final assignment for the course Analyzing Data. The answers to the questions as well as large chunks of code are based on the course material, such as earlier lab assingments and the lecture slides. 

This repository includes two types of files: 
- `.csv` Comma-separated values; includes the data we need to work with for the assignment
    - trump_tweets.csv
    - sanders_tweets.csv
    - trump_sanders_tweets.csv
- `.ipynb` My Notebook, created in Google Colab, includes the assignment
    - Assignment3_AD_S3756262.ipynb
- `.bin` The most optimal trained model in my Notebook. Downloading and loading this helps working with the same results, instead of retraining.
